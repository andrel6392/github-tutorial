## Git vs. GitHub

### Git
Git is a type of code language used on the command line. It can serve as version control for your code because it saves how your code looked before you made a drastic change that caused an error and you want to get back to your old code, before the error. Even though Git is in the word Github, you do not need to use Github when using git. It is completely optional.
### Github
Github is where your code gets stored. Atlhough you have to set up a connection between Github and your repository so that you can see your code being stored in the cloud. You have to `add` `commit` and `push` before being able to see the changes you make to your repository. Even though most people use Github for storing their code, it can store many other documents and files. For example, it can hold the lyrics to different songs, legal files, architectural plans. If you are going to use Github you have to use git, it is not optional.

On the menu you have to look for SSH and GPG keys. Click on make a new key and then stop there. Now you have to open up your cloud9 and sign,then click on the gear icon and go to SSH Keys. There you should see a code beginning with `ssh-rsa` or something close to that. Copy and Paste that kay and go back to github. There you will paste the code
